error when building the image

- We discovered that disk space issues and a Java version mismatch were preventing the successful build of your Docker image.

*freeing up disk space, 
*removed Java 21 and installed Java 11, which your application requires.

Still unable to build the image

*We ensured that the "Compile," "Test," and "Package" stages were all using the same Docker image (maven:3.8.5-openjdk-17). This consistency ensures that the build process occurs in the same environment, making the target directory accessible across these stages.

*Stash and Unstash:
The stash command was used to save the JAR file generated during the "Build&Package" stage. 
By stashing the JAR file, we ensured that it could be retrieved later in the "Build and Push Docker Image" stage using unstash.

The use of stash and unstash provided a reliable method to pass artifacts between stages, and by maintaining a consistent environment across the relevant stages, we avoided the problem of missing files.
